# Comprehensive Inventory Management System - Implementation Summary

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1. **Batch-Level Inventory Tracking**
- **ProductBatch Model**: Tracks individual stock batches with expiry dates, purchase prices, and quantities

### 2. **Expiry Management & Dead Stock Handling**
- **Automated Expiry Detection**: Daily scheduled checks using node-cron
- **Dead Stock Processing**: Automatic marking of expired batches with stock movements
- **Expiry Notifications**: Enhanced alerts system with expiry warnings

### 3. **Dynamic Pricing & Promotions**
- **Promotion System**: Time-window based promotions with automatic price resolution
- **Price Change Tracking**: Detailed logging of all price changes with reasons
- **Batch-Level Pricing**: Each batch maintains its purchase price for accurate cost calculations

### 4. **Enhanced Analytics & Reporting**
- **Detailed Analytics**: Comprehensive analytics with revenue, cost, and profit tracking
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV and PDF export for all analytics reports
- **Pre-Aggregated Data**: Daily analytics snapshots for improved performance
- **Developer Metrics**: System for collecting and analyzing application usage metrics

### 5. **Robust Scheduling System**
- **Node-Cron Integration**: Reliable scheduled tasks with retry mechanisms
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking expiry checks and analytics generation
- **Status Tracking**: Complete visibility into scheduled job execution
